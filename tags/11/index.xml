      <description>After the release of Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Replication v10 last year, I wrote a PowerShell script to automate the upgrade. It&amp;rsquo;s as easy as they come as it enabled one-click upgrades of Veeam environments.
With the release of v11, I wanted to continue the tradition to enable those with multiple Veeam servers, the easy button for mass upgrades to the latest version of the product. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce the release of an updated version of this script for v11!</description>

      <description>Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Replication v11 officially launched last week! With a new version of the product that is jam-packed with features, it&amp;rsquo;s no wonder that it&amp;rsquo;s already passed 15,000 unique downloads! Even before it was released, I was already being asked the question&amp;hellip;when will the Veeam Collection for Ansible support v11?
The answer is&amp;hellip;right now! The collection now fully supports all major components of the Veeam Availablility Suite:
 Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Replication Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager Veeam ONE  To the credit of the Veeam development team, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much I had to do on my end for this.</description>
